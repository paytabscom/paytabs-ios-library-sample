### Pay with Card


1. Configure the billing & shipping info, the shipping info is optional

```swift
let billingDetails = PaymentSDKBillingDetails(name: "John Smith",
                                            email: "email@test.com",
                                            phone: "+2011111111",
                                            addressLine: "address",
                                            city: "Dubai",
                                           state: "Dubai",
                                           countryCode: "ae", // ISO alpha 2
                                           zip: "12345")
                                                   
let shippingDetails = PaymentSDKShippingDetails(name: "John Smith",
                                            email: "email@test.com",
                                            phone: "+2011111111",
                                            addressLine: "address",
                                            city: "Dubai",
                                           state: "Dubai",
                                           countryCode: "ae", // ISO alpha 2
                                           zip: "12345")
                                              
```

2. Create object of `PaymentSDKConfiguration` and fill it with your credentials and payment details.

```
let configuration = PaymentSDKConfiguration(profileID: profileID,
                                       serverKey: serverKey,
                                       clientKey: clientKey,
                                       currency: "AED",
                                       amount: 5.0,
                                       merchantCountryCode: "AE")
            .cartDescription("Flowers")
            .cartID("1234")
            .screenTitle("Pay with Card")
            .billingDetails(billingDetails)
```

3. You are now ready to start payment and handle `PaymentManagerDelegate` 

```swift
PaymentManager.startCardPayment(on: self, 
                             configuration: configuration,
                             delegate: self)

```

### Pay with Apple Pay

1. Follow the guide [Steps to configure Apple Pay][applepayguide] to learn how to configure ApplePay with PayTabs.

2. Do the steps 1 and 2 from **Pay with Card** although you can ignore Billing & Shipping details and Apple Pay will handle it, also you must pass the **merchant name** and **merchant identifier** parameters.

```
let configuration = PaymentSDKConfiguration(profileID: profileID,
                                       serverKey: serverKey,
                                       clientKey: clientKey,
                                       currency: "AED",
                                       amount: 5.0,
                                       merchantCountryCode: "AE")
            .cartDescription("Flowers")
            .cartID("1234")
            .screenTitle("Pay with Card")
            .merchantName("Flowers Store")
            .merchantAppleBundleID("merchant.com.bundleID")
            .simplifyApplePayValidation(true)
                                    
```

3. To simplify ApplePay validation on all user's billing info, pass **simplifyApplePayValidation** parameter in the configuration with **true**.

```swift
configuration.simplifyApplePayValidation = true
```

4. Call `startApplePayPayment` to start payment

```swift
PaymentManager.startApplePayPayment(on: self, 
                             configuration: configuration,
                             delegate: self)
```

### Pay with Alternative Payment Methods
It becomes easy to integrate with other payment methods in your region like STCPay, OmanNet, KNet, Valu, Fawry, UnionPay, and Meeza, to serve a large sector of customers.

1. Do the steps 1 and 2 from **Pay with Card**
2. Choose one or more of the payment methods you want to support

```swift
configuration.alternativePaymentMethods = [.stcPay]
```

3. Call `startAlternativePaymentMethod` to start payment

```swift
PaymentManager.startAlternativePaymentMethod(on: self, 
                             configuration: configuration,
                             delegate: self)
```


### Delegates
Here you will receive the transaction details and errors.

```swift
extension ViewController: PaymentManagerDelegate {
    func paymentManager(didFinishTransaction transactionDetails: PaymentSDKTransactionDetails?, error: Error?) {
        if let transactionDetails = transactionDetails {
            print("Response Code: " + (transactionDetails.paymentResult?.responseCode ?? ""))
            print("Result: " + (transactionDetails.paymentResult?.responseMessage ?? ""))
            print("Token: " + (transactionDetails.token ?? ""))
            print("Transaction Reference: " + (transactionDetails.transactionReference ?? ""))
            print("Transaction Time: " + (transactionDetails.paymentResult?.transactionTime ?? "" ))
       if transactionDetails.isSuccess() {
                print("Successful transaction")
          }
        } else if let error = error {
            // Handle errors
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Transaction response
you can use transactionDetails?.isSuccess() to ensure a successful transaction ..

if the transaction is not successful you should check for the corresponding failure code you will receive the code in 
```transactionDetails?.paymentResult?.responseCode ``` .. all codes can be found in  [Payment Response Codes][responseCodes]

## Force Shipping Info Validation
By default, the validation on shipping info is disabled.

```swift
configuration.forceShippingInfo = true
```

## Show Billing or Shipping Info Section
By default, the billing and shipping info section is disappeared, sets its flag to `true` to let the SDK internally handle the missing billing & shipping info.

```swift
configuration.showBillingInfo = true
configuration.showShippingInfo = true
```

## Link billing name with card holder name
By default, the billing name is linked with card holder name, if you set its flag to `false` the billing name and the card holder name will be seperated
```
configuration.linkBillingNameWithCard = true
```

## Tokenisation
To enable tokenisation, please follow the below instructions.

1. Request token

```swift
configuration.tokeniseType = .userOptinoal // read more about the tokeniseType in the enums section 
configuration.tokenFormat = .hex32 // read more about the tokenFormat in the enums section  

```
After passing those parameters, you will receive token and transaction reference in the delegate, save them for future usage.

2. Pass the token & transaction reference

```swift
configuration.token = token
configuration.transactionReference = transactionreference
```

## Theme
Use the following guide to cusomize the colors, font, and logo by configuring the theme and pass it to the payment configuration.

![UI guide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13621658/109432213-d7981380-7a12-11eb-9224-c8fc12b0024d.jpg)

```swift
let theme = PaymentSDKTheme.default
theme.logoImage = UIImage(named: "Logo") //Change merchant logo.
theme.backgroundColor = .blue
theme.buttonFontColor = .red
configuration.theme = theme
```

## Localization
You can use the strings file below to copy the key and add it to your app localizable file and overwrite the value to yours. 

* [English][englishstrings]
* [Arabic][arabicstrings]

## Enums

Those enums will help you in customizing your configuration.

* Tokenise types

 The default type is none

```swift
public enum TokeniseType: Int, Codable {
    case none // tokenise is off
    case merchantMandatory // tokenise is forced
    case userMandatory // tokenise is forced as per user approval
    case userOptinoal // tokenise if optional as per user approval
}
```

* Token formats

The default format is hex32

```swift
public enum TokenFormat: String {
    case none = "1"
    case hex32 = "2"
    case alphaNum20 = "3"
    case digit22 = "4"
    case digit16 = "5"
    case alphaNum32 = "6"
}
```

* Transaction Type

The default type is sale

```swift
public enum TransactionType: String, CaseIterable {
    case sale
    case authorize = "auth"
}
```

```swift
configuration.transactionType = .sale
```

* Alternative Payment Methods

```swift
public enum AlternativePaymentMethod: String {
    case unionPay = "unionpay"
    case stcPay = "stcpay"
    case valu
    case meezaQR = "meezaqr"
    case omannet
    case knetCredit  = "knetcredit"
    case knetDebit  = "knetdebit"
    case fawry
}
```

```swift
configuration.transactionType = .sale
```
